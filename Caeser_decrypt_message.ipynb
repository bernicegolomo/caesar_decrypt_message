            "eve s diary  by mark twain    saturday   i am almost a whole day old  now  i arrived yesterday  that is as it seems to me  and it must be so  for if there was a   day before yesterday i was not there when it happened  or i should remember it  it could be  of course  that it did happen  and   that i was not noticing  very well  i will be very watchful now  and if any day before yesterdays happen i will make a note of it    it will be best to start right and not let the record get confused  for some instinct tells me that these details are going to be   important to the historian some day  for i feel like an experiment  i feel exactly like an experiment  it would be impossible for   a person to feel more like an experiment than i do  and so i am coming to feel convinced that that is what i am  an experiment  just   an experiment  and nothing more     then if i am an experiment  am i the whole of it  no  i think not  i think the rest of it is part of it  i am the main part of it    but i think the rest of it has its share in the matter  is my position assured  or do i have to watch it and take care of it  the   latter  perhaps  some instinct tells me that eternal vigilance is the price of supremacy   that is a good phrase  i think  for one so young      everything looks better today than it did yesterday  in the rush of finishing up yesterday  the mountains were left in a ragged condition    and some of the plains were so cluttered with rubbish and remnants that the aspects were quite distressing  noble and beautiful works of   art should not be subjected to haste  and this majestic new world is indeed a most noble and beautiful work  and certainly marvelously near   to being perfect  notwithstanding the shortness of the time  there are too many stars in some places and not enough in others  but that can   be remedied presently  no doubt  the moon got loose last night  and slid down and fell out of the scheme   a very great loss  it breaks my   heart to think of it  there isn t another thing among the ornaments and decorations that is comparable to it for beauty and finish  it should   have been fastened better  if we can only get it back again   but of course there is no telling where it went to  and besides  whoever gets it   will hide it  i know it because i would do it myself  i believe i can be honest in all other matters  but i already begin to realize that the   core and center of my nature is love of the beautiful  a passion for the beautiful  and that it would not be safe to trust me with a moon that   belonged to another person and that person didn t know i had it  i could give up a moon that i found in the daytime  because i should be afraid   some one was looking  but if i found it in the dark  i am sure i should find some kind of an excuse for not saying anything about it  for i do   love moons  they are so pretty and so romantic  i wish we had five or six  i would never go to bed  i should never get tired lying on the moss bank   and looking up at them     stars are good  too  i wish i could get some to put in my hair  but i suppose i never can  you would be surprised to find how far off they are    for they do not look it  when they first showed  last night  i tried to knock some down with a pole  but it didn t reach  which astonished me    then i tried clouds till i was all tired out  but i never got one  it was because i am left handed and cannot throw good  even when i aimed at   the one i wasn t after i couldn t hit the other one  though i did make some close shots  for i saw the black blot of the cloud sail right into   the midst of the golden clusters forty or fifty times  just barely missing them  and if i could have held out a little longer maybe i could have   got one     so i cried a little  which was natural  i suppose  for one of my age  and after i was rested i got a basket and started for a place on the extreme   rim of the circle  where the stars were close to the ground and i could get them with my hands  which would be better  anyway  because i could   gather them tenderly then  and not break them  but it was farther than i thought  and at last i had go give it up  i was so tired i couldn t drag   my feet another step  and besides  they were sore and hurt me very much     i couldn t get back home  it was too far and turning cold  but i found some tigers and nestled in among them and was most adorably comfortable    and their breath was sweet and pleasant  because they live on strawberries  i had never seen a tiger before  but i knew them in a minute by the   stripes  if i could have one of those skins  it would make a lovely gown     today i am getting better ideas about distances  i was so eager to get hold of every pretty thing that i giddily grabbed for it  sometimes when it   was too far off  and sometimes when it was but six inches away but seemed a foot  alas  with thorns between  i learned a lesson  also i made an axiom   all out of my own head   my very first one  the scratched experiment shuns the thorn  i think it is a very good one for one so young     i followed the other experiment around  yesterday afternoon  at a distance  to see what it might be for  if i could  but i was not able to make out    i think it is a man  i had never seen a man  but it looked like one  and i feel sure that that is what it is  i realize that i feel more curiosity   about it than about any of the other reptiles  if it is a reptile  and i suppose it is  for it has frowzy hair and blue eyes  and looks like a   reptile  it has no hips  it tapers like a carrot  when it stands  it spreads itself apart like a derrick  so i think it is a reptile  though it   may be architecture     i was afraid of it at first  and started to run every time it turned around  for i thought it was going to chase me  but by and by i found it was   only trying to get away  so after that i was not timid any more  but tracked it along  several hours  about twenty yards behind  which made it   nervous and unhappy  at last it was a good deal worried  and climbed a tree  i waited a good while  then gave it up and went home     today the same thing over  i ve got it up the tree again     sunday   it is up there yet  resting  apparently  but that is a subterfuge  sunday isn t the day of rest  saturday is appointed for that  it looks   to me like a creature that is more interested in resting than it anything else  it would tire me to rest so much  it tires me just to sit around   and watch the tree  i do wonder what it is for  i never see it do anything     they returned the moon last night  and i was so happy  i think it is very honest of them  it slid down and fell off again  but i was not distressed    there is no need to worry when one has that kind of neighbors  they will fetch it back  i wish i could do something to show my appreciation  i would   like to send them some stars  for we have more than we can use  i mean i  not we  for i can see that the reptile cares nothing for such things     it has low tastes  and is not kind  when i went there yesterday evening in the gloaming it had crept down and was trying to catch the little speckled   fishes that play in the pool  and i had to clod it to make it go up the tree again and let them alone  i wonder if that is what it is for  hasn t it   any heart  hasn t it any compassion for those little creature  can it be that it was designed and manufactured for such ungentle work  it has the   look of it  one of the clods took it back of the ear  and it used language  it gave me a thrill  for it was the first time i had ever heard speech    except my own  i did not understand the words  but they seemed expressive     when i found it could talk i felt a new interest in it  for i love to talk  i talk  all day  and in my sleep  too  and i am very interesting  but if   i had another to talk to i could be twice as interesting  and would never stop  if desired     if this reptile is a man  it isn t an it  is it  that wouldn t be grammatical  would it  i think it would be he  i think so  in that case one would   parse it thus  nominative  he  dative  him  possessive  his n  well  i will consider it a man and call it he until it turns out to be something else    this will be handier than having so many uncertainties     next week sunday   all the week i tagged around after him and tried to get acquainted  i had to do the talking  because he was shy  but i didn t mind   it  he seemed pleased to have me around  and i used the sociable  we  a good deal  because it seemed to flatter him to be included     wednesday   we are getting along very well indeed  now  and getting better and better acquainted  he does not try to avoid me any more  which is a   good sign  and shows that he likes to have me with him  that pleases me  and i study to be useful to him in every way i can  so as to increase his   regard  during the last day or two i have taken all the work of naming things off his hands  and this has been a great relief to him  for he has no   gift in that line  and is evidently very grateful  he can t think of a rational name to save him  but i do not let him see that i am aware of his   defect  whenever a new creature comes along i name it before he has time to expose himself by an awkward silence  in this way i have saved him many   embarrassments  i have no defect like this  the minute i set eyes on an animal i know what it is  i don t have to reflect a moment  the right name   comes out instantly  just as if it were an inspiration  as no doubt it is  for i am sure it wasn t in me half a minute before  i seem to know just   by the shape of the creature and the way it acts what animal it is     when the dodo came along he thought it was a wildcat  i saw it in his eye  but i saved him  and i was careful not to do it in a way that could hurt   his pride  i just spoke up in a quite natural way of pleasing surprise  and not as if i was dreaming of conveying information  and said   well  i do   declare  if there isn t the dodo   i explained  without seeming to be explaining   how i know it for a dodo  and although i thought maybe he was a   little piqued that i knew the creature when he didn t  it was quite evident that he admired me  that was very agreeable  and i thought of it more   than once with gratification before i slept  how little a thing can make us happy when we feel that we have earned it     thursday   my first sorrow  yesterday he avoided me and seemed to wish i would not talk to him  i could not believe it  and thought there was some   mistake  for i loved to be with him  and loved to hear him talk  and so how could it be that he could feel unkind toward me when i had not done   anything  but at last it seemed true  so i went away and sat lonely in the place where i first saw him the morning that we were made and i did not   know what he was and was indifferent about him  but now it was a mournful place  and every little thing spoke of him  and my heart was very sore  i   did not know why very clearly  for it was a new feeling  i had not experienced it before  and it was all a mystery  and i could not make it out     but when night came i could not bear the lonesomeness  and went to the new shelter which he has built  to ask him what i had done that was wrong and   how i could mend it and get back his kindness again  but he put me out in the rain  and it was my first sorrow     sunday   it is pleasant again  now  and i am happy  but those were heavy days  i do not think of them when i can help it     i tried to get him some of those apples  but i cannot learn to throw straight  i failed  but i think the good intention pleased him  they are   forbidden  and he says i shall come to harm  but so i come to harm through pleasing him  why shall i care for that harm     monday   this morning i told him my name  hoping it would interest him  but he did not care for it  it is strange  if he should tell me his name    i would care  i think it would be pleasanter in my ears than any other sound     he talks very little  perhaps it is because he is not bright  and is sensitive about it and wishes to conceal it  it is such a pity that he should   feel so  for brightness is nothing  it is in the heart that the values lie  i wish i could make him understand that a loving good heart is riches    and riches enough  and that without it intellect is poverty     although he talks so little  he has quite a considerable vocabulary  this morning he used a surprisingly good word  he evidently recognized  himself    that it was a good one  for he worked in in twice afterward  casually  it was good casual art  still it showed that he possesses a certain quality of   perception  without a doubt that seed can be made to grow  if cultivated     where did he get that word  i do not think i have ever used it     no  he took no interest in my name  i tried to hide my disappointment  but i suppose i did not succeed  i went away and sat on the moss bank with my   feet in the water  it is where i go when i hunger for companionship  some one to look at  some one to talk to  it is not enough  that lovely white   body painted there in the pool   but it is something  and something is better than utter loneliness  it talks when i talk  it is sad when i am sad    it comforts me with its sympathy  it says   do not be downhearted  you poor friendless girl  i will be your friend   it is a good friend to me  and   my only one  it is my sister     that first time that she forsook me  ah  i shall never forget that   never  never  my heart was lead in my body  i said   she was all i had  and now   she is gone   in my despair i said   break  my heart  i cannot bear my life any more   and hid my face in my hands  and there was no solace for me    and when i took them away  after a little  there she was again  white and shining and beautiful  and i sprang into her arms     that was perfect happiness  i had known happiness before  but it was not like this  which was ecstasy  i never doubted her afterward  sometimes she   stayed away  maybe an hour  maybe almost the whole day  but i waited and did not doubt  i said   she is busy  or she is gone on a journey  but she   will come   and it was so  she always did  at night she would not come if it was dark  for she was a timid little thing  but if there was a moon she   would come  i am not afraid of the dark  but she is younger than i am  she was born after i was  many and many are the visits i have paid her  she is   my comfort and my refuge when my life is hard  and it is mainly that     tuesday   all the morning i was at work improving the estate  and i purposely kept away from him in the hope that he would get lonely and come  but   he did not     at noon i stopped for the day and took my recreation by flitting all about with the bees and the butterflies and reveling in the flowers  those   beautiful creatures that catch the smile of god out of the sky and preserve it  i gathered them  and made them into wreaths and garlands and clothed   myself in them while i ate my luncheon   apples  of course  then i sat in the shade and wished and waited  but he did not come     but no matter  nothing would have come of it  for he does not care for flowers  he called them rubbish  and cannot tell one from another  and thinks   it is superior to feel like that  he does not care for me  he does not care for flowers  he does not care for the painted sky at eventide  is there   anything he does care for  except building shacks to coop himself up in from the good clean rain  and thumping the melons  and sampling the grapes  and fingering the fruit on the trees  to see how those properties are coming along     i laid a dry stick on the ground and tried to bore a hole in it with another one  in order to carry out a scheme that i had  and soon i got an awful   fright  a thin  transparent bluish film rose out of the hole  and i dropped everything and ran  i thought it was a spirit  and i was so frightened    but i looked back  and it was not coming  so i leaned against a rock and rested and panted  and let my limps go on trembling until they got steady   again  then i crept warily back  alert  watching  and ready to fly if there was occasion  and when i was come near  i parted the branches of a   rose bush and peeped through  wishing the man was about  i was looking so cunning and pretty  but the sprite was gone  i went there  and there was   a pinch of delicate pink dust in the hole  i put my finger in  to feel it  and said ouch  and took it out again  it was a cruel pain  i put my   finger in my mouth  and by standing first on one foot and then the other  and grunting  i presently eased my misery  then i was full of interest    and began to examine     i was curious to know what the pink dust was  suddenly the name of it occurred to me  though i had never heard of it before  it was fire  i was as   certain of it as a person could be of anything in the world  so without hesitation i named it that  fire     i had created something that didn t exist before  i had added a new thing to the world s uncountable properties  i realized this  and was proud of   my achievement  and was going to run and find him and tell him about it  thinking to raise myself in his esteem   but i reflected  and did not do it    no  he would not care for it  he would ask what it was good for  and what could i answer  for if it was not good for something  but only beautiful    merely beautiful   so i sighed  and did not go  for it wasn t good for anything  it could not build a shack  it could not improve melons  it could   not hurry a fruit crop  it was useless  it was a foolishness and a vanity  he would despise it and say cutting words  but to me it was not despicable    i said   oh  you fire  i love you  you dainty pink creature  for you are beautiful  and that is enough   and was going to gather it to my breast  but   refrained  then i made another maxim out of my head  though it was so nearly like the first one that i was afraid it was only a plagiarism   the burnt experiment shuns the fire      i wrought again  and when i had made a good deal of fire dust i emptied it into a handful of dry brown grass  intending to carry it home and keep it   always and play with it  but the wind struck it and it sprayed up and spat out at me fiercely  and i dropped it and ran  when i looked back the blue   spirit was towering up and stretching and rolling away like a cloud  and instantly i thought of the name of it  smoke   though  upon my word  i had   never heard of smoke before     soon brilliant yellow and red flares shot up through the smoke  and i named them in an instant  flames  and i was right  too  though these were the   very first flames that had ever been in the world  they climbed the trees  then flashed splendidly in and out of the vast and increasing volume of   tumbling smoke  and i had to clap my hands and laugh and dance in my rapture  it was so new and strange and so wonderful and so beautiful     he came running  and stopped and gazed  and said not a word for many minutes  then he asked what it was  ah  it was too bad that he should ask such   a direct question  i had to answer it  of course  and i did  i said it was fire  if it annoyed him that i should know and he must ask  that was not   my fault  i had no desire to annoy him  after a pause he asked      how did it come      another direct question  and it also had to have a direct answer      i made it      the fire was traveling farther and farther off  he went to the edge of the burned place and stood looking down  and said      what are these       fire coals      he picked up one to examine it  but changed his mind and put it down again  then he went away  nothing interests him     but i was interested  there were ashes  gray and soft and delicate and pretty  i knew what they were at once  and the embers  i knew the embers  too    i found my apples  and raked them out  and was glad  for i am very young and my appetite is active  but i was disappointed  they were all burst open   and spoiled  spoiled apparently  but it was not so  they were better than raw ones  fire is beautiful  some day it will be useful  i think     friday   i saw him again  for a moment  last monday at nightfall  but only for a moment  i was hoping he would praise me for trying to improve the   estate  for i had meant well and had worked hard  but he was not pleased  and turned away and left me  he was also displeased on another account    i tried once more to persuade him to stop going over the falls  that was because the fire had revealed to me a new passion  quite new  and distinctly   different from love  grief  and those others which i had already discovered  fear  and it is horrible   i wish i had never discovered it  it gives me   dark moments  it spoils my happiness  it makes me shiver and tremble and shudder  but i could not persuade him  for he has not discovered fear yet    and so he could not understand me     extract from adam s diary    perhaps i ought to remember that she is very young  a mere girl and make allowances  she is all interest  eagerness  vivacity  the world is to her a   charm  a wonder  a mystery  a joy  she can t speak for delight when she finds a new flower  she must pet it and caress it and smell it and talk to   it  and pour out endearing names upon it  and she is color mad  brown rocks  yellow sand  gray moss  green foliage  blue sky  the pearl of the dawn    the purple shadows on the mountains  the golden islands floating in crimson seas at sunset  the pallid moon sailing through the shredded cloud rack    the star jewels glittering in the wastes of space  none of them is of any practical value  so far as i can see  but because they have color and   majesty  that is enough for her  and she loses her mind over them  if she could quiet down and keep still a couple minutes at a time  it would be a   reposeful spectacle  in that case i think i could enjoy looking at her  indeed i am sure i could  for i am coming to realize that she is a quite   remarkably comely creature   lithe  slender  trim  rounded  shapely  nimble  graceful  and once when she was standing marble white and sun drenched   on a boulder  with her young head tilted back and her hand shading her eyes  watching the flight of a bird in the sky  i recognized that she was   beautiful     monday noon   if there is anything on the planet that she is not interested in it is not in my list  there are animals that i am indifferent to    but it is not so with her  she has no discrimination  she takes to all of them  she thinks they are all treasures  every new one is welcome     when the mighty brontosaurus came striding into camp  she regarded it as an acquisition  i considered it a calamity  that is a good sample of the   lack of harmony that prevails in our views of things  she wanted to domesticate it  i wanted to make it a present of the homestead and move out    she believed it could be tamed by kind treatment and would be a good pet  i said a pet twenty one feet high and eighty four feet long would be no   proper thing to have about the place  because  even with the best intentions and without meaning any harm  it could sit down on the house and mash   it  for any one could see by the look of its eye that it was absent minded     still  her heart was set upon having that monster  and she couldn t give it up  she thought we could start a dairy with it  and wanted me to help   milk it  but i wouldn t  it was too risky  the sex wasn t right  and we hadn t any ladder anyway  then she wanted to ride it  and look at the scenery    thirty or forty feet of its tail was lying on the ground  like a fallen tree  and she thought she could climb it  but she was mistaken  when she got   to the steep place it was too slick and down she came  and would have hurt herself but for me     was she satisfied now  no  nothing ever satisfies her but demonstration  untested theories are not in her line  and she won t have them  it is the   right spirit  i concede it  it attracts me  i feel the influence of it  if i were with her more i think i should take it up myself  well  she had one   theory remaining about this colossus  she thought that if we could tame it and make him friendly we could stand in the river and use him for a bridge    it turned out that he was already plenty tame enough  at least as far as she was concerned   so she tried her theory  but it failed  every time she   got him properly placed in the river and went ashore to cross over him  he came out and followed her around like a pet mountain  like the other   animals  they all do that     friday   tuesday  wednesday  thursday  and today  all without seeing him  it is a long time to be alone  still  it is better to be alone than   unwelcome     i had to have company  i was made for it  i think  so i made friends with the animals  they are just charming  and they have the kindest disposition   and the politest ways  they never look sour  they never let you feel that you are intruding  they smile at you and wag their tail  if they ve got one   and they are always ready for a romp or an excursion or anything you want to propose  i think they are perfect gentlemen  all these days we have   had such good times  and it hasn t been lonesome for me  ever  lonesome  no  i should say not  why  there s always a swarm of them around    sometimes as much as four or five acres  you can t count them  and when you stand on a rock in the midst and look out over the furry expanse it   is so mottled and splashed and gay with color and frisking sheen and sun flash  and so rippled with stripes  that you might think it was a lake    only you know it isn t  and there s storms of sociable birds  and hurricanes of whirring wings  and when the sun strikes all that feathery commotion    you have a blazing up of all the colors you can think of  enough to put your eyes out     we have made long excursions  and i have seen a great deal of the world  almost all of it  i think  and so i am the first traveler  and the only one    when we are on the march  it is an imposing sight   there s nothing like it anywhere  for comfort i ride a tiger or a leopard  because it is soft and   has a round back that fits me  and because they are such pretty animals  but for long distance or for scenery i ride the elephant  he hoists me up   with his trunk  but i can get off myself  when we are ready to camp  he sits and i slide down the back way     the birds and animals are all friendly to each other  and there are no disputes about anything  they all talk  and they all talk to me  but it must   be a foreign language  for i cannot make out a word they say  yet they often understand me when i talk back  particularly the dog and the elephant    it makes me ashamed  it shows that they are brighter than i am  for i want to be the principal experiment myself  and i intend to be  too     i have learned a number of things  and am educated  now  but i wasn t at first  i was ignorant at first  at first it used to vex me because  with all   my watching  i was never smart enough to be around when the water was running uphill  but now i do not mind it  i have experimented and experimented   until now i know it never does run uphill  except in the dark  i know it does in the dark  because the pool never goes dry  which it would  of course    if the water didn t come back in the night  it is best to prove things by actual experiment  then you know  whereas if you depend on guessing and   supposing and conjecturing  you never get educated     some things you can t find out  but you will never know you can t by guessing and supposing  no  you have to be patient and go on experimenting until   you find out that you can t find out  and it is delightful to have it that way  it makes the world so interesting  if there wasn t anything to find   out  it would be dull  even trying to find out and not finding out is just as interesting as trying to find out and finding out  and i don t know but   more so  the secret of the water was a treasure until i got it  then the excitement all went away  and i recognized a sense of loss     by experiment i know that wood swims  and dry leaves  and feathers  and plenty of other things  therefore by all that cumulative evidence you know   that a rock will swim  but you have to put up with simply knowing it  for there isn t any way to prove it  up to now  but i shall find a way  then   that excitement will go  such things make me sad  because by and by when i have found out everything there won t be any more excitements  and i do   love excitements so  the other night i couldn t sleep for thinking about it     at first i couldn t make out what i was made for  but now i think it was to search out the secrets of this wonderful world and be happy and thank the   giver of it all for devising it  i think there are many things to learn yet  i hope so  and by economizing and not hurrying too fast i think they will   last weeks and weeks  i hope so  when you cast up a feather it sails away on the air and goes out of sight  then you throw up a clod and it doesn t    it comes down  every time  i have tried it and tried it  and it is always so  i wonder why it is  of course it doesn t come down  but why should it   seem to  i suppose it is an optical illusion  i mean  one of them is  i don t know which one  it may be the feather  it may be the clod  i can t   prove which it is  i can only demonstrate that one or the other is a fake  and let a person take his choice     by watching  i know that the stars are not going to last  i have seen some of the best ones melt and run down the sky  since one can melt  they can   all melt  since they can all melt  they can all melt the same night  that sorrow will come  i know it  i mean to sit up every night and look at them   as long as i can keep awake  and i will impress those sparkling fields on my memory  so that by and by when they are taken away i can by my fancy   restore those lovely myriads to the black sky and make them sparkle again  and double them by the blur of my tears     after the fall    when i look back  the garden is a dream to me  it was beautiful  surpassingly beautiful  enchantingly beautiful  and now it is lost  and i shall not   see it any more     the garden is lost  but i have found him  and am content  he loves me as well as he can  i love him with all the strength of my passionate nature    and this  i think  is proper to my youth and sex  if i ask myself why i love him  i find i do not know  and do not really much care to know  so i   suppose that this kind of love is not a product of reasoning and statistics  like one s love for other reptiles and animals  i think that this must   be so  i love certain birds because of their song  but i do not love adam on account of his singing  no  it is not that  the more he sings the more   i do not get reconciled to it  yet i ask him to sing  because i wish to learn to like everything he is interested in  i am sure i can learn  because   at first i could not stand it  but now i can  it sours the milk  but it doesn t matter  i can get used to that kind of milk     it is not on account of his brightness that i love him  no  it is not that  he is not to blame for his brightness  such as it is  for he did not make   it himself  he is as god make him  and that is sufficient  there was a wise purpose in it  that i know  in time it will develop  though i think it   will not be sudden  and besides  there is no hurry  he is well enough just as he is     it is not on account of his gracious and considerate ways and his delicacy that i love him  no  he has lacks in this regard  but he is well enough   just so  and is improving     it is not on account of his industry that i love him  no  it is not that  i think he has it in him  and i do not know why he conceals it from me    it is my only pain  otherwise he is frank and open with me  now  i am sure he keeps nothing from me but this  it grieves me that he should have a   secret from me  and sometimes it spoils my sleep  thinking of it  but i will put it out of my mind  it shall not trouble my happiness  which is   otherwise full to overflowing     it is not on account of his education that i love him  no  it is not that  he is self educated  and does really know a multitude of things  but   they are not so     it is not on account of his chivalry that i love him  no  it is not that  he told on me  but i do not blame him  it is a peculiarity of sex  i   think  and he did not make his sex  of course i would not have told on him  i would have perished first  but that is a peculiarity of sex  too    and i do not take credit for it  for i did not make my sex     then why is it that i love him  merely because he is masculine  i think     at bottom he is good  and i love him for that  but i could love him without it  if he should beat me and abuse me  i should go on loving him  i   know it  it is a matter of sex  i think     he is strong and handsome  and i love him for that  and i admire him and am proud of him  but i could love him without those qualities  he he were   plain  i should love him  if he were a wreck  i should love him  and i would work for him  and slave over him  and pray for him  and watch by his   bedside until i died     yes  i think i love him merely because he is mine and is masculine  there is no other reason  i suppose  and so i think it is as i first said  that   this kind of love is not a product of reasonings and statistics  it just comes  none knows whence  and cannot explain itself  and doesn t need to     it is what i think  but i am only a girl  the first that has examined this matter  and it may turn out that in my ignorance and inexperience i   have not got it right     forty years later    it is my prayer  it is my longing  that we may pass from this life together  a longing which shall never perish from the earth  but shall have place   in the heart of every wife that loves  until the end of time  and it shall be called by my name     but if one of us must go first  it is my prayer that it shall be i  for he is strong  i am weak  i am not so necessary to him as he is to me  life   without him would not be life  now could i endure it  this prayer is also immortal  and will not cease from being offered up while my race continues    i am the first wife  and in the last wife i shall be repeated     at eve s grave    adam  wheresoever she was  there was eden \n",
